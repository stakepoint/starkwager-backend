Getting Started
To get started with the StarkWager App, follow the instructions below:

1. Install Dependencies
The project uses pnpm as the package manager. First, install pnpm globally:

bash
Copy
npm install -g pnpm
Then install the project dependencies:

bash
Copy
pnpm install
2. Running the Development Server
Start the development server to run the app locally:

bash
Copy
pnpm dev
Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Testing with snforge
To test the Cairo smart contracts, we use snforge, a testing framework for StarkNet smart contracts. Follow the steps below to set up and run tests.

1. Install snforge
If you haven't already, install snforge using the following command:

bash
Copy
cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry snforge
Alternatively, you can use starknet-foundry, which includes snforge and other tools:

bash
Copy
cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry --profile local --force
Verify the installation by running:

bash
Copy
snforge --version
2. Write Tests
Tests for Cairo smart contracts are written in Cairo itself. Place your test files in the tests directory. For example:

cairo
Copy
// tests/test_wager.cairo
#[test]
fn test_create_wager() {
    // Your test logic here
}
3. Run Tests
To run all tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy
snforge test
This will execute all test files in the tests directory and display the results in the terminal.
